# a/

The console prints “B text” and “A default”.

Because, obj1 is B, so the address of obj1 is the address of B. Therefore, when calling the display function of obj1, the program calls the display function of B. And because obj2 is A, so when calling the display function of obj2, the program calls the display function of A.

# b/

It will leak memory because when destroying A, the program doesn’t delete pointer m_s. To solve this problem, we implement our virtual destructor for A.

```cpp
virtual ~A(){
    delete[] m_s;
}
```

# c/

```cpp
friend const istream& operator>> (istream &input, A &obj){
    const int Max=100000;
    input.getline(obj.m_s,Max);
}
```
